\title{Optimal Shrinkage of Singular Values}
\usage{
optshrink_impl(singvals, beta, loss, sigma)
}
\arguments{
\item{singvals}{A numeric vector of singular values to be shrunk.}

\item{beta}{A numeric value between 0 and 1 representing the aspect ratio of the matrix (\code{n/d}), where \code{n} is the number of columns and \code{d} is the number of rows.}

\item{loss}{A character string specifying the type of loss function to use for shrinkage. Must be one of \code{"fro"} (Frobenius norm), \code{"op"} (Operator norm), or \code{"nuc"} (Nuclear norm).}

\item{sigma}{A positive numeric value representing the noise level to be used in the shrinkage process.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of shrunk singular values.
}
\description{
Performs optimal shrinkage of singular values according to a specified loss function, given the shape parameter \code{beta} and noise level \code{sigma}.
This function adjusts the singular values of a matrix to reduce noise and enhance signal components based on the Marƒçenko-Pastur distribution.
}
\details{
The function applies different shrinkage strategies based on the specified loss function:
\describe{
  \item{\code{"fro"}}{Uses Frobenius norm shrinkage, which minimizes the mean squared error.}
  \item{\code{"op"}}{Uses Operator norm shrinkage, which targets the largest singular value.}
  \item{\code{"nuc"}}{Uses Nuclear norm shrinkage, which adjusts the sum of singular values while penalizing those close to zero.}
}

Internal helper functions are used to compute the adjusted singular values according to the specified loss type:
\describe{
  \item{\code{opt_fro_shrink}}{Calculates shrinkage based on the Frobenius norm.}
  \item{\code{opt_op_shrink}}{Calculates shrinkage based on the Operator norm.}
  \item{\code{opt_nuc_shrink}}{Calculates shrinkage based on the Nuclear norm.}
}
}
